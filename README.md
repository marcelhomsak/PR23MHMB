# Crime in Slovenia

My colleague and I will be data-analyzing the level of crime in Slovenia.

We will be gathering data from "https://pxweb.stat.si/SiStat/sl/Podrocja/Index/53/kakovost-zivljenja/?kriminaliteta#55". We will be using the data in the form of ".csv" files.

Questions we want to answer:
- How is crime distributed among municipalities or regions?
- Does the level of crime decrease, increase, or remain the same over the years?
- What are the factors that contribute to increased crime (unemployment, religion...)?
- And much more!
